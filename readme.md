# preprocessor.py User Manual

`preprocessor.py` is a single-file Python source preprocessor.

It recursively expands:

```python
from module import *
```


into the source code of the referenced local Python file, eventually producing a single combined Python file that can be distributed or executed independently.

Conceptually, it is similar to the C/C++:

```c
#include "module.c"
```

mechanism.

However, during development, your project remains a normal multi-file Python project. IDEs, LSPs, autocomplete, static analyzers, type checkers, code navigation, and refactoring tools can continue to understand the project normally.

---

# 1. Basic Usage

Suppose your project looks like this:

```text
project/
├── preprocessor.py
├── main.py
├── tools.py
└── utils.py
```

`main.py`:

```python
from tools import *

def main():
    print(double("hello"))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

`tools.py`:

```python
from utils import *

def double(value):
    return duplicate(value)
```

`utils.py`:

```python
def duplicate(value):
    return value + value
```

Run the following command from the `project/` directory:

```zsh
python3 preprocessor.py -i main.py
```

The preprocessor generates:

```text
main.flat.py
```

Both:

```python
from tools import *
```

and:

```python
from utils import *
```

are recursively replaced with their actual source code.

You can then run:

```zsh
python3 main.flat.py
```

---

# 2. Basic Command Format

General form:

```zsh
python3 preprocessor.py [options] -i INPUT
```

The most common command is:

```zsh
python3 preprocessor.py -i main.py
```

To specify the output file:

```zsh
python3 preprocessor.py \
    -i main.py \
    -o dist/app.py
```

---

# 3. `-i` / `--input`

Specifies the entry-point Python file.

Example:

```zsh
python3 preprocessor.py -i main.py
```

Equivalent to:

```zsh
python3 preprocessor.py --input main.py
```

The input file is the starting point of the dependency graph.

For example:

```text
main.py
    ↓
tools.py
    ↓
utils.py
```

Running:

```zsh
python3 preprocessor.py -i main.py
```

starts from `main.py` and recursively traces all expandable:

```python
from ... import *
```

statements.

---

# 4. `-o` / `--output`

Specifies the generated output file.

Example:

```zsh
python3 preprocessor.py \
    -i main.py \
    -o build/app.py
```

This generates:

```text
build/app.py
```

If `-o` is omitted:

```zsh
python3 preprocessor.py -i main.py
```

then:

```text
main.py
```

generates:

```text
main.flat.py
```

Likewise:

```text
server.py
```

generates:

```text
server.flat.py
```

---

# 5. Which Imports Are Expanded?

Only wildcard imports of the form:

```python
from module import *
```

are treated as include directives.

For example:

```python
from tools import *
```

is expanded if the preprocessor can resolve a local:

```text
tools.py
```

file.

---

## Imports That Are Expanded

```python
from tools import *
```

```python
from package.tools import *
```

```python
from .tools import *
```

```python
from ..common import *
```

```python
from . import *
```

---

## Imports That Are Not Expanded

A normal import:

```python
import tools
```

is not expanded.

A named import:

```python
from tools import helper
```

is not expanded.

An aliased import:

```python
import tools as t
```

is not expanded.

These imports remain in the generated file unchanged.

---

# 6. Standard Library and Third-Party Imports

By default, if:

```python
from something import *
```

cannot be resolved to a local Python source file, it is preserved unchanged.

For example:

```python
from math import *
```

remains:

```python
from math import *
```

in the generated output.

This allows normal standard-library and third-party imports to continue working.

---

# 7. `--strict`

If you want every wildcard import to resolve to a local source file, use:

```zsh
python3 preprocessor.py \
    -i main.py \
    --strict
```

For example:

```python
from nonexistent import *
```

If no local:

```text
nonexistent.py
```

can be found, normal mode:

```zsh
python3 preprocessor.py -i main.py
```

preserves:

```python
from nonexistent import *
```

However:

```zsh
python3 preprocessor.py \
    -i main.py \
    --strict
```

reports an error and stops preprocessing.

---

# 8. Module Resolution Rules

For:

```python
from tools import *
```

the preprocessor attempts to resolve:

```text
tools.py
```

or:

```text
tools/__init__.py
```

For:

```python
from package.tools import *
```

it attempts to resolve:

```text
package/tools.py
```

or:

```text
package/tools/__init__.py
```

---

# 9. `-r` / `--root`

`--root` specifies the source root used for absolute local imports.

By default:

> root = directory containing the input file

For example:

```text
project/
├── preprocessor.py
├── main.py
└── lib/
    └── tools.py
```

If the source contains:

```python
from lib.tools import *
```

then:

```zsh
python3 preprocessor.py -i main.py
```

normally resolves it correctly.

---

If your project instead looks like:

```text
project/
├── preprocessor.py
├── app/
│   └── main.py
└── src/
    └── tools.py
```

and:

```python
from tools import *
```

should resolve relative to:

```text
src/
```

use:

```zsh
python3 preprocessor.py \
    -i app/main.py \
    --root src
```

or the short form:

```zsh
python3 preprocessor.py \
    -i app/main.py \
    -r src
```

---

# 10. `-I` / `--search-path`

Additional local module search directories can be supplied with:

```text
-I / --search-path
```

Example project:

```text
project/
├── preprocessor.py
├── main.py
├── src/
│   └── tools.py
└── shared/
    └── common.py
```

Run:

```zsh
python3 preprocessor.py \
    -i main.py \
    -I src \
    -I shared
```

`-I` may be specified multiple times.

Example:

```zsh
python3 preprocessor.py \
    -i main.py \
    -I src \
    -I shared \
    -I vendor
```

---

# 11. Relative Imports

Normal Python relative imports are supported.

For example:

```python
from .tools import *
```

and:

```python
from ..common import *
```

can be resolved according to the source file's package location.

Example:

```text
package/
├── main.py
├── tools.py
└── helpers/
    └── common.py
```

Modules may continue to use standard Python relative-import syntax.

---

# 12. Circular Dependencies

Circular dependencies do not cause infinite recursion.

For example:

```text
main.py
    ↓
another.py
    ↓
tools.py
    ↓
another.py
```

That is:

`main.py`

```python
from another import *
```

`another.py`

```python
from tools import *
```

`tools.py`

```python
from another import *
```

The preprocessor detects:

```text
another → tools → another
```

and stops recursively expanding that cycle.

Each source file is emitted at most once.

---

# 13. Duplicate Dependencies

For example:

```text
main.py
├── a.py
│   └── common.py
└── b.py
    └── common.py
```

Even though:

```text
common.py
```

is referenced through two different paths, it is emitted only once.

This behavior is called:

```text
include once
```

---

# 14. Default Source Markers

By default, the generated file contains structural markers such as:

```python
# >>> preprocessor: begin tools.py
```

and:

```python
# <<< preprocessor: end tools.py
```

These indicate which generated sections came from which dependency.

Example:

```python
# >>> preprocessor: begin tools.py

def double(value):
    return value * 2

# <<< preprocessor: end tools.py
```

Circular or duplicate includes may also produce explanatory comments.

These markers are useful for:

* reading generated files;
* debugging;
* understanding dependencies;
* identifying source boundaries.

---

# 15. `--no-markers`

To generate a cleaner output file:

```zsh
python3 preprocessor.py \
    -i main.py \
    --no-markers
```

This disables structural comments such as:

```python
# >>> preprocessor: begin ...
```

and:

```python
# <<< preprocessor: end ...
```

The actual Python code is unaffected.

---

# 16. `--inline-source-map`

If you want each generated line to indicate which original file and line number it came from, use:

```zsh
python3 preprocessor.py \
    -i main.py \
    --inline-source-map
```

For example, if line 70 of:

```text
main.py
```

contains:

```python
print("hello")
```

the output becomes:

```python
print("hello") # main.py 70
```

Example:

```python
def main(): # main.py 68
    message = "hello" # main.py 69
    print(message) # main.py 70
```

Dependencies are traced in the same way:

```python
def double(value): # tools.py 21
    return value * 2 # tools.py 22
```

This is useful for:

* debugging;
* inspecting flattened output;
* comparing generated code to source files;
* quickly locating original code.

---

## Inline Source Map Safety Rules

The preprocessor does not add inline comments where doing so would change Python semantics.

For example:

```python
MESSAGE = """hello
world
"""
```

must not become:

```python
MESSAGE = """hello # main.py 10
world # main.py 11
"""
```

because the inserted text would become part of the string.

Therefore, such lines are not forcibly annotated.

---

Likewise:

```python
value = 1 + \
    2
```

must not become:

```python
value = 1 + \ # main.py 20
```

because that would break Python syntax.

Therefore:

> `--inline-source-map` annotates source lines whenever it is safe to do so, but never at the cost of changing program behavior.

---

# 17. `--source-marker`

The second source-tracing mode is:

```zsh
python3 preprocessor.py \
    -i main.py \
    --source-marker
```

Instead of adding a comment after every line, it inserts source-location markers before contiguous source regions.

For example:

```python
# >>> preprocessor: source main.py:70
print("hello")
```

Or:

```python
# >>> preprocessor: source main.py:68
def main():
    message = "hello"
    print(message)
```

This indicates that the first source line after the marker corresponds to:

```text
main.py:68
```

and subsequent uninterrupted source lines continue from there.

---

If preprocessing switches to another dependency:

```python
# >>> preprocessor: source main.py:20

def foo():
    pass

# >>> preprocessor: source tools.py:1

def helper():
    pass

# >>> preprocessor: source main.py:24

def bar():
    pass
```

This representation is more compact than an inline source map.

---

# 18. `--inline-source-map` vs. `--source-marker`

### Inline Source Map

Use:

```zsh
--inline-source-map
```

Output:

```python
x = 10 # main.py 20
y = 20 # main.py 21
print(x + y) # main.py 22
```

Advantages:

* source location is visible on every annotated line;
* very convenient for debugging.

Disadvantages:

* generated output is longer;
* source comments are more visually intrusive.

---

### Source Marker

Use:

```zsh
--source-marker
```

Output:

```python
# >>> preprocessor: source main.py:20
x = 10
y = 20
print(x + y)
```

Advantages:

* cleaner output;
* closer to the original source;
* source provenance is still preserved.

For normal inspection, prefer:

```zsh
--source-marker
```

For detailed debugging, prefer:

```zsh
--inline-source-map
```

---

# 19. The Two Source-Tracing Modes Are Mutually Exclusive

Do not use:

```zsh
python3 preprocessor.py \
    -i main.py \
    --inline-source-map \
    --source-marker
```

at the same time.

These options are mutually exclusive.

Choose one source-tracing mode.

---

# 20. `--source-marker` with `--no-markers`

This is a useful combination:

```zsh
python3 preprocessor.py \
    -i main.py \
    --source-marker \
    --no-markers
```

Structural markers such as:

```python
# >>> preprocessor: begin tools.py
```

are disabled.

However, source-location markers such as:

```python
# >>> preprocessor: source tools.py:20
```

are still generated.

This gives relatively clean output while retaining source tracing.

---

# 21. `if __name__ == "__main__"`

Suppose a dependency:

```text
tools.py
```

contains:

```python
def helper():
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("testing tools")
```

Under normal Python imports:

```python
from tools import *
```

the following code does not execute:

```python
print("testing tools")
```

Blindly flattening the entire file would change that behavior.

Therefore, by default, the preprocessor removes conventional top-level:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
```

blocks from dependency files.

However, the root input file's own:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

block is preserved.

---

# 22. `--keep-main-guards`

If you intentionally want dependency:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
```

blocks to remain in the output, use:

```zsh
python3 preprocessor.py \
    -i main.py \
    --keep-main-guards
```

This option is generally not recommended.

Use it only when you explicitly want behavior closer to literal textual inclusion.

---

# 23. `from __future__ import ...`

The preprocessor automatically handles special imports such as:

```python
from __future__ import annotations
```

Python requires future imports to appear near the beginning of the module.

Therefore, if a dependency contains:

```python
from __future__ import annotations
```

the preprocessor does not simply copy it into the middle of the generated file.

Instead it:

1. collects future imports;
2. deduplicates them;
3. removes them from their original positions;
4. places them in a valid position near the top of the final module.

For example:

```python
"""Application."""

from __future__ import annotations
```

remains a valid module structure.

Users normally do not need to handle this manually.

---

# 24. Source Encodings

The preprocessor uses Python's own source-encoding detection rules.

For example:

```python
# -*- coding: latin-1 -*-
```

is supported.

Different dependencies may use different encodings.

The final generated file is always written as:

```text
UTF-8
```

Therefore, source files do not need to be manually converted first.

---

# 25. Shebang Handling

If the root input file begins with:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
```

the shebang is preserved in the generated file.

Dependency shebangs are not treated as additional final-file shebangs.

---

# 26. `--check-only`

To verify that the project can be flattened successfully without writing an output file, use:

```zsh
python3 preprocessor.py \
    -i main.py \
    --check-only
```

This still performs:

1. dependency discovery;
2. source parsing;
3. circular dependency detection;
4. preprocessing;
5. flattening;
6. final Python syntax validation.

However, it does not write:

```text
main.flat.py
```

This is useful for validation before a build.

A recommended workflow is:

```zsh
python3 preprocessor.py \
    -i main.py \
    --check-only
```

and, if that succeeds:

```zsh
python3 preprocessor.py -i main.py
```

---

# 27. `--list-deps`

To display the source files used by the build:

```zsh
python3 preprocessor.py \
    -i main.py \
    --list-deps
```

Example output:

```text
main.py
another.py
tools.py
common.py
```

The files are shown in their actual processing/inclusion order.

This is useful for:

* checking dependencies;
* detecting unexpectedly included files;
* debugging module resolution.

---

# 28. `-v` / `--verbose`

Enable verbose diagnostics:

```zsh
python3 preprocessor.py \
    -i main.py \
    -v
```

or:

```zsh
python3 preprocessor.py \
    -i main.py \
    --verbose
```

This prints additional information about dependency resolution, unresolved imports, circular dependencies, and related processing.

A useful debugging command is:

```zsh
python3 preprocessor.py \
    -i main.py \
    --check-only \
    --list-deps \
    -v
```

---

# 29. Displaying the Version

Run:

```zsh
python3 preprocessor.py --version
```

Current version:

```text
preprocessor.py 0.2.0
```

---

# 30. Displaying CLI Help

Run:

```zsh
python3 preprocessor.py --help
```

or:

```zsh
python3 preprocessor.py -h
```

to display all available command-line options.

---

# 31. Recommended Development Workflow

During development, keep the project as a normal multi-file Python project:

```text
project/
├── main.py
├── tools.py
├── parser.py
├── utils.py
└── preprocessor.py
```

Write normal Python imports such as:

```python
from tools import *
from parser import *
```

Your IDE continues to treat them as regular Python modules.

---

During development, run the original project normally:

```zsh
python3 main.py
```

---

To validate flattening:

```zsh
python3 preprocessor.py \
    -i main.py \
    --check-only \
    --list-deps
```

---

To create a debugging build:

```zsh
python3 preprocessor.py \
    -i main.py \
    --inline-source-map
```

---

To create relatively clean output while retaining source tracing:

```zsh
python3 preprocessor.py \
    -i main.py \
    --source-marker \
    --no-markers
```

---

For a clean release build:

```zsh
python3 preprocessor.py \
    -i main.py \
    -o dist/app.py \
    --no-markers
```

---

Finally, test the generated file:

```zsh
python3 dist/app.py
```

---

# 32. Recommended Debugging Command

If something goes wrong, first run:

```zsh
python3 preprocessor.py \
    -i main.py \
    --check-only \
    --list-deps \
    -v
```

This allows you to:

* avoid modifying any output file;
* inspect dependencies;
* inspect module resolution;
* validate the final Python source.

If additional source-level tracing is needed:

```zsh
python3 preprocessor.py \
    -i main.py \
    --inline-source-map
```

Then inspect:

```text
main.flat.py
```

and its:

```python
# filename.py LINE
```

annotations.

---

# 33. Syntax Errors

If any source file contains invalid Python syntax, for example:

```python
def hello(
    print("hello")
```

the preprocessor detects the error before generating the final output.

The error report includes:

* filename;
* line number;
* column number;
* Python's syntax error message.

The final flattened output is also validated with:

```python
compile()
```

Therefore:

> Individual source files being valid does not guarantee that the flattened result is valid. The final output is checked again.

---

# 34. The Preprocessor Does Not Execute Project Source Code

During preprocessing, the tool only:

* reads source code;
* parses source code;
* analyzes imports;
* generates source code;
* compile-checks source code.

It does not discover dependencies by executing:

```python
import your_module
```

and it does not use:

```python
exec(...)
```

to run project source code.

Therefore, preprocessing itself does not trigger module runtime side effects.

---

# 35. Complete Example

Project:

```text
project/
├── preprocessor.py
├── main.py
├── another.py
└── tools.py
```

`main.py`:

```python
from another import *

def run():
    print(double_string("21"))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run()
```

`another.py`:

```python
from tools import *

def is_string(value):
    return isinstance(value, str)
```

`tools.py`:

```python
from another import *

def double_string(value):
    if is_string(value):
        return str(int(value) * 2)

    return value
```

This contains a circular dependency:

```text
another
    ↓
tools
    ↓
another
```

Run:

```zsh
python3 preprocessor.py \
    -i main.py \
    --source-marker
```

The preprocessor:

1. reads `main.py`;
2. resolves `another.py`;
3. resolves `tools.py`;
4. encounters `another.py` again;
5. detects the cycle;
6. does not expand the same source file again;
7. generates a single:

   ```text
   main.flat.py
   ```
8. validates the final Python syntax.

Then run:

```zsh
python3 main.flat.py
```

Expected output:

```text
42
```

# 36. When Should You Use This Tool?

This tool is suitable when you:

* want to develop a normal multi-file Python project;
* want to distribute a single Python file;
* want IDE and LSP support during development;
* do not want to introduce a custom `#include` syntax;
* are building small utilities;
* are building single-file CLIs;
* are building scripts;
* are building plugins;
* want easily distributable Python source;
* are experimenting with compiler/preprocessor-style tooling.

---

# 37. When Should You Not Use It?

If the application heavily depends on true Python module namespaces, for example:

```python
import foo

foo.value
```

or relies heavily on:

```python
__name__
__package__
__file__
sys.modules
```

as well as complex:

* import hooks;
* plugin systems;
* dynamic imports;
* module initialization side effects;
* C extension modules;

then you should not assume that flattened behavior will always exactly match the original multi-module project.

This tool is a:

```text
source preprocessor / source flattener
```

not a complete:

```text
Python import system emulator
```

---

# 38. Most Important Design Rule

Development source code should continue to use normal Python:

```python
from tools import *
```

Your IDE understands it as normal Python.

The preprocessor simply gives that existing syntax an additional build-time meaning:

> Include this local module's source code in the generated single-file output.

Therefore:

> Keep the original multi-file project as the real source code.

Treat:

```text
*.flat.py
```

as:

> automatically generated build artifacts.

Do not manually edit `.flat.py`.

Make changes in the original:

```text
.py
```

files, then run the preprocessor again.
